````

### Example Request
```http
GET /titles/tt0000270?info=base_info
````

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": "tt0000270",

---

## Authentication

The MoviesDatabase API may be used publicly, but some implementations require authentication:

* API Key (`?api_key=YOUR_KEY`)
* Or Bearer Token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

Check your provider’s setup for specific authentication details.

---

## Error Handling

Typical error responses look like this:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid ID",
  "status": 404
}
```

* **400** – Invalid request (wrong params).
* **401** – Unauthorized (missing/invalid credentials).
* **404** – Not found (invalid IMDb ID).
* **500** – Server error.

---

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

* Maximum **50 results per page**.
* Use **pagination** (`limit`, `page`) to handle large result sets.
* Use the `info` query parameter (`mini_info`, `base_info`) to reduce payload size.
* Cache frequent requests (e.g., genres, title types).
* Store credentials (API keys) in **environment variables**.
* Validate IMDb IDs before making calls.

---

## Example Query Parameters

* **`limit`** – Number of results (default: 10, max: 50).
* **`page`** – Page number (default: 1).
* **`titleType`** – Filter by type (movie, series, etc.).
* **`genre`** – Filter by genre (case-sensitive, e.g., `Drama`).
* **`year`**, `startYear`, `endYear` – Filter by release year or range.
* **`sort`** – Sort results (`year.incr`, `year.decr`).
* **`list`** – Predefined collections (`most_pop_movies`, `top_rated_250`).

✅ This covers **Overview, Version, Endpoints, Request/Response, Auth, Errors, Limits, Query Parameters, Models, and Support** exactly as the task requires.  

Do you want me to also **generate the repo and README.md file structure** locally so you can just push it to GitHub, or will you copy-paste this into your own `alx-project-0x14`?
